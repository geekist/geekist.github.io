  <p>Hi all,</p>

  <p>It is with great sadness that I have to inform you that Kloudsec is shutting down.</p>

  <p><strong>Why is Kloudsec shutting down?</strong></p>

  <ol>
    <li>We have been funding Kloudsec out of our own pocket</li>
    <li>Kloudsec is very expensive to maintain (upwards to $10000 / month)</li>
    <li>We are unable to make money from Kloudsec, nor raise any funds for it</li>
  </ol>

  <p><strong>We will shut Kloudsec down on 1st August</strong></p>

  <p>From now till then, we will not be maintaining the service.</p>

  <p><strong>Migrating out of Kloudsec</strong></p>

  <p>Migrating out of Kloudsec is extremely simple. All you have to do is to point your domain back at its origin server.</p>

  <p>You will lose the HTTPS cert. But you can fix that by</p>

  <ul>
    <li>either issuing your own LetsEncrypt certificate</li>
    <li>or using Cloudflare.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Lessons learnt</strong></p>

  <p>From the start, we are extremely lucky to have a small revenue stream that let us to experiment with cool products. And Kloudsec is one of our biggest experiment.</p>

  <p>There are a couple of things we did right, and a couple we did wrong.</p>

  <p>We did right by having the right team come together, building a seriously sophiscated product. (Thank you Ivan and Bach)</p>

  <p>We did wrong by building a sophiscated product that made it hard for a small team to maintain, let alone scale.</p>

  <p>We did wrong by building a product that was not immediately useful enough so much so that people will pay for.</p>

  <p>We did wrong by building a product that was too expensive to maintain.</p>

  <p>We did wrong by assuming that traction solves all ailments. Not in Singapore, you donâ€™t. There is no good venture money for real hard-tech software startups in Singapore.</p>

  <p>We did right with pulling the plug so we can learn from these mistakes and work on the next product.</p>

  <p><strong>Whatâ€™s next for us</strong></p>

  <p>From Kloudsec, we identified a few niche problems that we will be looking to solve. In other words, we will continually be building.</p>

  <p>And you can be sure from our next product onwards, we will charge right from day 1 so we can sustain the product financially.</p>

  <p>Lastly, thank you!</p>

  <p>Thank you. Most of you have spoken to me, or read the posts Iâ€™ve written on Github, on Hacker News, or Producthunt about Kloudsec. You guys took a leap of faith in trusting this small unknown team and product, and used us.</p>

  <p>Iâ€™m sorry to disappoint you with this piece of news, but Iâ€™ll try better next time.</p>
